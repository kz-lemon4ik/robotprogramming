# Project Planning: Inverse Kinematics Solver

## Problem Statement

Design and implement a ROS-based inverse kinematics solver for a 2-link planar robotic manipulator. The system must calculate joint angles given target end-effector coordinates and provide real-time visualization in RViz.

## Requirements Analysis

### Functional Requirements
- Accept target coordinates (x, y) as input
- Calculate corresponding joint angles (θ1, θ2)
- Handle unreachable target positions gracefully
- Provide real-time visualization of robot motion
- Support ROS communication protocols

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Real-time performance (< 100ms response time)
- Numerical stability for edge cases
- Clean, maintainable C++ code
- ROS Noetic compatibility
- Ubuntu 20.04 LTS support

## Technical Architecture

### System Components
1. **IKCalculator Class**: Core mathematical solver
2. **ik_solver_node**: ROS node for communication
3. **URDF Model**: Robot description
4. **Launch System**: Automated startup
5. **Visualization**: RViz configuration

### Data Flow
```
Target Goal (x,y) → ik_solver_node → IKCalculator → Joint Angles (θ1,θ2) → Joint States → RViz
```

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Mathematical Foundation
- Derive inverse kinematics equations

- User documentation
- System testing
- Repository finalization

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks
- **Numerical instability**: Mitigated by careful implementation and testing
- **Performance issues**: Addressed through efficient algorithms
- **ROS compatibility**: Resolved by following ROS standards

### Timeline Risks
- **Complex mathematics**: Allocated sufficient time for derivation and testing
- **Integration challenges**: Planned incremental integration approach

## Success Criteria

1. System correctly calculates joint angles for reachable targets
2. Handles unreachable targets without crashing
3. Visualization updates in real-time
4. Code passes all test cases
5. Documentation is complete and clear
