## Phase 3: Robot Modeling
**Target**: Create URDF model and visualization  
**Expected Duration**: 2 commits (commits 3, 13-17)

### Tasks
- [ ] Design 2-link manipulator URDF (urdf/robot.urdf)
- [ ] Configure robot_state_publisher integration
- [ ] Set up RViz visualization
- [ ] Synchronize joint names between code and URDF
- [ ] Ensure proper coordinate frame transformations

### Key Deliverables

- Configurable parameters

## Phase 5: Documentation and Polish
**Target**: Finalize project for delivery  
**Expected Duration**: 3 commits (commits 20-22)

### Tasks
- [ ] Create comprehensive README.md
- [ ] Add extensive code comments
- [ ] Final code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] System testing and validation
- [ ] Version tagging and repository finalization

### Key Deliverables
- Complete user documentation
- Production-ready code
- Validated system performance

## Quality Assurance Throughout

### Code Standards
- All code in English with meaningful names
- Minimal but effective commenting
- Follow ROS and C++ best practices
- No AI-generated patterns (visual separators, emojis)

### Testing Strategy
- Unit testing for mathematical functions
- Integration testing for ROS communication
- System testing with various target positions
- Performance validation under typical usage

### Documentation Requirements
- Technical documentation for developers
- User guide for operation
- Mathematical derivation explanation
- System architecture overview

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Mathematical complexity**: Address through careful research and validation
- **ROS integration issues**: Resolve via incremental development and testing
- **Performance problems**: Monitor and optimize during development

### Timeline Management
- **Scope creep**: Maintain focus on core requirements
- **Integration delays**: Plan buffer time between phases
- **Testing overhead**: Allocate time for proper validation

## Success Metrics

### Phase Completion Criteria
1. **Phase 1**: Mathematical solver passes all test cases
2. **Phase 2**: ROS communication works reliably
3. **Phase 3**: Robot visualizes correctly in RViz
4. **Phase 4**: User can control system intuitively
5. **Phase 5**: Documentation is complete and system is delivery-ready

### Overall Project Success
- System calculates correct joint angles for reachable targets
- Handles edge cases gracefully without crashes
- Provides smooth real-time visualization
- Code is clean, documented, and maintainable
- Repository demonstrates professional development practices
